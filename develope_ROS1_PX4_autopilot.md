# ROS1 and PX4 
## Setup `PX4` <---> `mavros` <---> `QGC` communication

When `mavros` runs on remote PC, the communication with `PX4` is through `telemetry` or a [wifi module](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/telemetry/esp8266_wifi_module.html). The key is to turnoff the auto connection of `QGC` and `PX4` via `telemetry`(see the [instructions](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/issues/624)) and this [answer](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/issues/878). Or the `mavros` is not able to use the `telemetry` to comminicate with `PX4`. The `QGC` also runs on remote PC and can communicate with `mavros` with UDP. The result is like `FCU <---telemetry---> MAVROS <---UDP---> QGC`.

When `mavros` runs on a companion computer like single board computer mounted on the drone, the default `fcu_url:=/dev/ttyACM0:57600` means the companion computer connect with fcu via usb port. If `QGC` run on remote PC, SSH to companion computer and launch `mavros` use this [command](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_38649880/article/details/88342904) and use the IP of the remote PC `gcs_url:=udp://@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` or search udp automatically: `gcs_url:=udp-b://@`.
